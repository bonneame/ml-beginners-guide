# ml-beginners-guide

Hi, this repository is designed as a digest and aggregate of all my knowledge in Machine Learning and Data Science. You will find here: 
- Jupyter-notebooks with my simple ml-projects 
- Jupyter-notebooks with the basics of machine learning covering different theoretical aspects in ML/DS
- Materials for further reading and education
- Lectures, articles and other helpful stuff that I find useful 

Feel free to contribute to any code, add learning materials and share this repository with your friends. There is no final goals of this repo, so that it will be continually filled with any materials.  
  
Let's make ML/SD easy and comprehensible for anyone :slightly_smiling_face:
